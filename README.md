# Power-BI-Dashboard

  •	Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for “Awesome Chocolates” to monitor and analyze core business KPIs including Sales ($34M), Boxes Sold (2M), Shipments (6K), Costs ($14M),       and Profit ($21M), with a dynamic Profit Margin Gauge (60.3%) for instant financial health tracking.
	•	Integrated monthly trend visualizations (Sales, Boxes, Shipments, Profit) with time-series line charts, showing Month-over-Month (MoM) changes, including negative growth flags (e.g.,       MoM Sales ↓10.8%) and corresponding recovery indicators (e.g., Profit ↑15.6%).
	•	Implemented an intuitive shipment analysis histogram highlighting distribution patterns and outliers (e.g., 10.2% LBS flagged in red), enhancing logistics and operations review.
	•	Built a detailed sales team performance matrix, showcasing individual metrics for 15+ salespeople, including:
	•	Total Sales and Profit (e.g., Kelci Walkden: $1.5M Sales, $988K Profit)
	•	Profit % and LBS %, with visual progress bars
	•	Visual status indicators (✔️/❌) to track efficiency benchmarks
	•	Enabled drill-down by region and product category (e.g., Bars, Bites, Australia, Canada, etc.) using slicers and interactive navigation.
	•	Designed the layout with user-centric interactivity and clean UI, allowing stakeholders to easily compare trends, identify underperformers, and make data-driven decisions.
